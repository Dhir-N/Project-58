            I like reading and playing games a lot, I know it is a strange combination of hobbies but I somehow make it work, I have been reading books and playing games for what feels like basically my entire life I think. I like doing other things too but these two are my personal favourites. Whenever I am frustrated with something, I like to relax by playing a good game or reading a good book.</p>
